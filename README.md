## Installation

 You‚Äôll need to use the express-handlebarsLinks to an external site. package to use Handlebars.js for your Views, use the MySQL2Links to an external site. and SequelizeLinks to an external site. packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

You‚Äôll also need the dotenv package links to an external site. to use environment variables, the bcrypt packageLinks to an external site. to hash passwords, and the express-sessionLinks to an external site. and connect-session-sequelizeLinks to an external site. packages to add authentication

## Usage

he express-sessionLinks to an external site. package stores the session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the default behavior and you do not have to do anything to your application other than implement the npm package.
